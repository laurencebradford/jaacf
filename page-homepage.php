          Judie’s Table provides meals to families visiting their loved ones 
          in Hospice care.  These donations also provide for the Staff who 
          are often unable to have regular meals due to the performance of 
          urgent duties at the Hospice.  The food donations are solicited 
          through the foundation, picked up and delivered to the Hospice by 
          volunteers.
